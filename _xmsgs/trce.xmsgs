<msg type="warning" file="Timing" num="3159" delta="new" >The DCM, <arg fmt="%s" index="1">PCLK_GEN_INST</arg>, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.
</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="3386" delta="new" >Intersecting Constraints found and resolved.  For more information, see the TSI report.  Please consult the Xilinx Command Line Tools User Guide for information on generating a TSI report.</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="3412" delta="new" >To improve timing, see the Timing Closure User Guide (UG612).</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="2752" delta="new" >To get complete path coverage, use the unconstrained paths option. All paths that are not constrained will be reported in the unconstrained paths section(s) of the report.</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="3339" delta="new" >The clock-to-out numbers in this timing report are based on a 50 Ohm transmission line loading model.  For the details of this model, and for more information on accounting for different loading conditions, please see the device datasheet.</msg>
