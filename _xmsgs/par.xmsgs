<msg type="warning" file="Timing" num="3159" delta="new" >The DCM, <arg fmt="%s" index="1">PCLK_GEN_INST</arg>, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="2761" delta="new" >N/A entries in the Constraints List may indicate that the constraint is not analyzed due to the following: No paths covered by this constraint; Other constraints intersect with this constraint; or This constraint was disabled by a Path Tracing Control. Please run the Timespec Interaction Report (TSI) via command line (trce tsi) or Timing Analyzer GUI.</msg>
